# Why I document electronically
Due to the huge amount of note taking required in my major I decided to use an electronic pen tablet to write down all my notes. This kept my notes organized, colored and easy for me to remember. Additionally it reduces paper waste and actually saves you money long term on paper and pens!

I am known for having really good notes and all my peers always want a sample of my notes to study from. ***This electronic note taking became a part of my work life because I can combine pictures, tables, codes and my writing all in one file!. Have a look at the sample pdf file I provided!***

## Equipment and Software used
I use the 'XP PEN' sold on amazon for $40 Canadian dollars. The software I use is Microsoft PowerPoint (pptx) and then I extract to pdf  to get the final notes.
